- **We have post-doc funding!**

- Automatic derivatives

    - Better samplers
    - Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
    - Laplace approximation & Gaussian quadrature
    - Maximum likelihood

- Separate into more modular packages:

    - NIMBLE compiler is useful as a separate tool.

- Better workflow

    - Saving and re-loading work! (This is surprisingly tricky.)
    - Deeped/easier parallelization.

- More packages that use nimble.

    - nimbleEcology (anyone want to get involved?)
