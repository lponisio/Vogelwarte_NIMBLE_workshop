# Model-generic programming

- We often want to write code that will work for any model.

    - It is also reasonable to write code for a specific model.

- The NIMBLE language has additional features for using model.
- All querying of model nodes, variables, and relationships **must** be done in `setup` code.
- Common design:

    - `setup` takes model and/or nodes as arguments.
    - `setup` queries the model to set up nodes needed in `run` code.
    - `run` code uses `calculate`, `simulate`, `values`, etc. (model-control features) with sets of nodes created in `setup`.
