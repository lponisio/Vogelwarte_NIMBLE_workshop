# Introduction to NIMBLE

Numerical Inference for statistical Models using Bayesian and Likelihood Estimation

* Model language + algorithm language
* Model language: A new dialect of BUGS/JAGS
* NIMBLE makes BUGS extensible: New functions and distributions
* A package of algorithms (MCMC, SMC, MCEM)
* Algorithm language: nimbleFunctions, embedded within R
* Compiler: Generates and compiles C++ from models and algorithms

# A basic example: the pump model

We'll use the *pump* model example from the original BUGS software. The data set
  describes the failure rates of some pumps.

### pump model summary

* `N`=10 pumps
* `x[i]` is number of failures for pump `i`, observed for time `t[i]`.
* `x[i] ~ lambda[i] * t[i]`
* `lambda[i]` is a random effect for pump `i`
* `lambda[i] ~ dgamma(alpha, beta)`
* `alpha` and `beta` are hyperparameters with priors.

# Write pump model

### Define the model code in R (or a separate file if you'd like) ###

```{r model-code}
library(nimble)
pumpCode <- nimbleCode({ 
  for (i in 1:N){

      # likelihood (data model)
      x[i] ~ dpois(lambda[i])

      # latent process (random effects)
      # linear predictor      
      lambda[i] <- theta[i]*t[i]
      # random effects distribution
      theta[i] ~ dgamma(alpha,beta)
  }
  # priors on hyperparameters
  alpha ~ dexp(1.0)
  beta ~ dgamma(0.1,1.0)
})
```

# Build pump model

### Build a model object that can be queried and manipulated in R

```{r build-model}
N <- 10
t <- c(94.3, 15.7, 62.9, 126, 5.24, 31.4, 1.05, 1.05, 2.1, 10.5)
x <- c(5, 1, 5, 14, 3, 19, 1, 1, 4, 22)
pumpConsts <- list(t = t, N = 10)
pumpData <- list(x = x)
pumpInits <- list(alpha = 1,
                  beta = 1,
                  theta = rep(0.1, pumpConsts$N))
pump <- nimbleModel(pumpCode, 
                    data = pumpData,
                    constants = pumpConsts,
                    inits = pumpInits)
```

# Explore pump model

### The model is an object you can use:
```{r use-pump}
pump$getNodeNames()
pump$theta
```

# Compile pump model

### Build a fast version of the model via C++ code generation and compilation

```{r, compile-model}
Cpump <- compileNimble(pump)
```

#### You can also use the compiled version directly
```{r use-compiled-model}
Cpump$theta
```

# Configure and build MCMC #

### Set up the configuration of samplers and build the samplers

```{r, conf}
pumpConf <- configureMCMC(pump)
pumpMCMC <- buildMCMC(pumpConf)
```

#### You can also do this in one step if no customization will be needed
```{r, conf2}
pumpMCMC <- buildMCMC(pump)
```

# Compile  and run the MCMC

```{r, compile}
CpumpMCMC <- compileNimble(pumpMCMC, project = pump)
```

```{r, run}
samples <- runMCMC(CpumpMCMC, niter = 1000)
```

### Look at the results
```{r, plot-samples}
dir.create("pump_samples", showWarnings = FALSE)
mcmcplot(samples, dir = "pump_samples")
```

The plots are [here](pump_samples/MCMCoutput.html).

# Other ways to run MCMC

- To quickly combine all steps, use `nimbleMCMC`.
- To take full control, use `CpumpMCMC$run(niter)`
- To compare multiple MCMC configurations, we'll learn `compareMCMCs`, which uses `MCMCsuite`
